Project Respiro!
This repository contains the initial implementation for a Federated Learning (FL) model designed for multi-class lung cancer classification. 
The goal is to enable privacy-preserving collaboration across multiple healthcare institutions while addressing data heterogeneity and communication challenges.

- Implements a basic FL setup using PyTorch & Flower
- Supports multiple clients with simulated data
- Focuses on efficient model aggregation and communication

for installations:
